|===

**Current stable version:** 1.0.0

== ⚠️ BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY NOTICE

**Smart contracts deployed to mainnet are IMMUTABLE.**

* **Testnet vulnerabilities:** Can be redeployed
* **Mainnet vulnerabilities:** Require proxy upgrade or emergency pause
* **Report mainnet vulnerabilities IMMEDIATELY** (Critical severity by default)

== Reporting a Vulnerability

**⚠️ DO NOT open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

**⚠️ DO NOT disclose mainnet contract vulnerabilities publicly before patch.**

=== Preferred Reporting Method

**Email:** security@example.com

**Subject line:** `[SECURITY] indieweb2-bastion - Brief description`

**For smart contract vulnerabilities, also include:**
* **Network:** Mainnet/Testnet/Local
* **Contract address:** 0x...
* **Deployment date:** If known

**PGP Key (optional):** https://example.com/pgp-key.asc

=== What to Include

1. **Description:** Detailed vulnerability explanation
2. **Impact:** Potential consequences (fund loss, privilege escalation, etc.)
3. **Reproduction:** Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
4. **Environment:**
   - Blockchain network (Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Internet Computer)
   - Solidity/Motoko version
   - Node.js/ReScript versions
   - Contract addresses
5. **Proof of Concept:** Transaction hashes, contract calls, screenshots
6. **Suggested Fix:** If known

**Example report:**

Subject: [SECURITY] indieweb2-bastion - Reentrancy in IdentityRegistry

Description:
IdentityRegistry.withdraw() vulnerable to reentrancy attack.

Impact:
Attacker can drain contract balance via recursive calls.

Reproduction:
1. Deploy malicious contract with fallback function
2. Call IdentityRegistry.withdraw()
3. Fallback triggers recursive withdraw before balance update

Environment:
- Ethereum Sepolia testnet
- Contract: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8...
- Solidity 0.8.20
- Deployed: 2025-01-15

PoC:
contract Attacker {
  IdentityRegistry target;

  function attack() external {
    target.withdraw();
  }

  fallback() external payable {
    if (address(target).balance > 0) {
      target.withdraw();
    }
  }
}

Suggested Fix:
Use checks-effects-interactions pattern:
1. Update balance state BEFORE external call
2. Or use ReentrancyGuard from OpenZeppelin
----

=== Response Timeline

* **Acknowledgment:** Within 24 hours (mainnet), 48 hours (testnet)
* **Initial assessment:** Within 3 days (mainnet), 1 week (testnet)
* **Status update:** Every 3 days (mainnet), 7 days (testnet)
* **Fix deployment:** 7-14 days (mainnet critical), 30-90 days (other)

=== Severity Levels

**Critical (Mainnet):** Fund loss, authentication bypass, privilege escalation
* Response: Emergency patch + proxy upgrade within 7 days
* Disclosure: After patch deployment + 14 days
* **May trigger emergency pause if actively exploited**

**High:** Reentrancy, integer overflow, access control bypass
* Response: Patch within 14 days (mainnet), 30 days (testnet)
* Disclosure: After patch deployment + 14 days

**Medium:** Information disclosure, DoS, gas optimization attacks
* Response: Patch within 30 days (mainnet), 60 days (testnet)
* Disclosure: After patch deployment + 30 days

**Low:** Minor information leaks, configuration issues
* Response: Patch in next release
* Disclosure: After patch deployment + 30 days

== Coordinated Disclosure

**We follow responsible disclosure:**

1. **Private report** to security@example.com
2. **Confirmation** and severity assessment
3. **Fix development** in private branch
4. **Security advisory** drafted (with CVE for mainnet)
5. **Patch deployment:**
   - **Mainnet:** Proxy upgrade via timelock governance
   - **Testnet:** Redeploy contracts
6. **Public disclosure** after coordinated timeline

**Embargo period:**
* **Mainnet:** 90 days from report or patch deployment (whichever is sooner)
* **Testnet:** 60 days

* **GitHub:** https://github.com/yourorg/indieweb2-bastion/security/advisories
* **Email list:** security-announce@example.com
* **On-chain:** Event logs in SecurityModule contract

**Format:** CVE-YYYY-XXXXX, severity, affected contracts/versions, mitigation

== Security Best Practices

=== Smart Contract Development

**Solidity:**
[source,solidity]
----
// ALWAYS use OpenZeppelin libraries
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract IdentityRegistry is ReentrancyGuard, Ownable {
    // Checks-effects-interactions pattern
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

        // Effects BEFORE interactions
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

        // Interactions last
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}
----

**Motoko (Internet Computer):**
[source,motoko]
----
// Use stable variables for upgradeable state
stable var identities : [(Principal, Identity)] = [];

// Principal-based access control
public shared(msg) func register(did : Text) : async Result.Result<(), Text> {
  if (not isAuthorized(msg.caller)) {
    return #err("Unauthorized");
  };
  // ...
};
----

=== Testing

**Required before mainnet deployment:**
[source,bash]
----
# Unit tests (100% coverage for critical functions)
just test-contracts

# Slither static analysis
slither contracts/

# Mythril symbolic execution
myth analyze contracts/IdentityRegistry.sol

# Echidna fuzzing
echidna-test contracts/IdentityRegistry.sol

# Testnet deployment + manual testing
just deploy-testnet
just test-integration-testnet
----

=== Deployment

**Never commit secrets:**
[source,bash]
----
# Use environment variables
export PRIVATE_KEY="..."  # From hardware wallet or secret manager
export INFURA_KEY="..."

# Or use encrypted keystore
cast wallet import deployer --interactive
----

**Mainnet deployment checklist:**
* [ ] All tests passing (unit + integration)
* [ ] Static analysis clean (Slither, Mythril)
* [ ] Fuzz testing completed (Echidna, Foundry)
* [ ] Code review by 2+ developers
* [ ] External audit completed (for high-value contracts)
* [ ] Testnet deployment successful
* [ ] Timelock configured (48+ hour delay)
* [ ] Emergency pause mechanism tested
* [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

=== Code Review

**Security checklist:**
* [ ] No secrets in code/commits
* [ ] User input validated/sanitized
* [ ] Access control on all admin functions
* [ ] Reentrancy guards on external calls
* [ ] Integer overflow/underflow checks (or Solidity 0.8+)
* [ ] Gas limits considered (avoid unbounded loops)
* [ ] Event logs for all state changes
* [ ] Proxy upgrade paths tested
* [ ] Emergency pause mechanism
* [ ] HTTPS enforced (off-chain components)

=== Dependencies

**Audit smart contract dependencies:**
[source,bash]
----
# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Update dependencies carefully (BREAKING CHANGES)
npm update

# For OpenZeppelin, pin to specific version
"@openzeppelin/contracts": "4.9.3"
