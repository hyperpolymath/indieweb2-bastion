== Overview

**indieweb2-bastion is a consent-first, decentralized identity platform.**

**Core Privacy Principles:**
* **Consent-first:** Users control their data
* **Decentralization:** No central data repository
* **Cryptographic sovereignty:** Users own their keys
* **Minimal data collection:** Only what's necessary
* **Transparency:** All data practices documented

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-21

== What Data We Collect

=== On-Chain Data (Public Blockchains)

**Ethereum/Polygon Smart Contracts:**

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
|Data Type |Purpose |Retention

|Wallet addresses
|Identity association
|Permanent (blockchain immutable)

|DID (Decentralized Identifier)
|Identity reference
|Permanent (blockchain immutable)

|Content hashes (IPFS CID)
|Identity metadata pointer
|Permanent (blockchain immutable)

|Timestamps
|Audit trail
|Permanent (blockchain immutable)

|Transaction hashes
|Verification
|Permanent (blockchain immutable)

|===

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** All on-chain data is **PUBLIC** and **PERMANENT**. Once written to mainnet, it **CANNOT** be deleted.

**Internet Computer Canisters:**

**Blockchain data is immutable.** You have:

* **Right to view:** All data is public via blockchain explorers
* **Right to context:** See this privacy policy for data usage
* **NO right to deletion:** Blockchain data cannot be removed

**Mitigation:**
* Use pseudonymous addresses (don't link to real identity)
* Store sensitive data off-chain (IPFS with encryption)
* Use new addresses for different contexts

=== Off-Chain Data (Full Rights)

**GDPR/CCPA Rights (if applicable):**

* **Right to access:** Request copy of your data
* **Right to deletion:** Request deletion of off-chain data
* **Right to rectification:** Request correction of inaccurate data
* **Right to portability:** Export your data in machine-readable format
* **Right to object:** Object to specific data processing

**How to exercise rights:**
Email: privacy@example.com with subject: `[PRIVACY REQUEST] <Your request>`

**Response time:** 30 days

=== Self-Sovereign Identity Rights

**As a DID holder, you control:**

* ✅ **Key rotation:** Change your cryptographic keys
* ✅ **Metadata updates:** Update DID document via IPFS
* ✅ **Service endpoints:** Add/remove service entries
* ✅ **Verifiable credentials:** Issue/revoke credentials
* ✅ **Consent:** Granular control over data sharing

== Data Retention
