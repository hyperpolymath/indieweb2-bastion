== Context

The project requires a comprehensive software quality and compliance framework that addresses:

* **Supply chain security** (audit-grade provenance, SBOM, reproducible builds)
* **Documentation quality** (instant legibility, onboarding, architectural clarity)
* **Interoperability** (multi-ecosystem packaging, WASM-first compilation)
* **Ethical transparency** (AI usage disclosure, carbon reporting, inclusivity)

For blockchain projects, additional considerations include:

* Smart contract immutability and upgrade patterns
* Multi-chain deployment provenance
* Carbon footprint of blockchain operations
* Security audit requirements

Rhodium Standard 0.5 provides a unified framework with blockchain-specific adaptations.

== Decision

**We adopt Rhodium Standard 0.5 as the minimum compliance framework for this repository, with blockchain-specific interpretations.**

**Target Level:** Rhodium Silver (immediate), Rhodium Gold (2025-06)

**Blockchain-Specific Adaptations:**

* REVERSIBILITY.adoc documents upgrade patterns, not rollback (mainnet deployments are immutable)
* Carbon reporting includes testnet usage and PoS chain considerations
* SLSA attestation for smart contract bytecode and deployment artifacts

== Consequences

=== Positive

* **Supply Chain Security:** SLSA attestation for contract deployments, bytecode provenance
* **Transparency:** Smart contract upgrade patterns documented, audit findings disclosed
* **Multi-Chain Support:** Standardized compliance across Ethereum, Polygon, and Internet Computer

=== Negative

* **Immutability Constraints:** Mainnet deployments cannot be rolled back (upgrade patterns only)
* **Complex Carbon Reporting:** Must account for testnet usage, PoS consensus, and execution costs

== Implementation

See link:../../.rhodium/WAIVER.adoc[WAIVER.adoc] for blockchain-specific waivers including Waiver-2025-006 (REVERSIBILITY adaptations).
