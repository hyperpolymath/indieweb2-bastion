== Purpose of This Document

This document provides transparent disclosure of all AI and LLM usage in the development of indieweb2-bastion, a multi-chain blockchain project with smart contracts and Web3 integrations.

== AI Tools Used

=== Claude Code (Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5)

**Tool:** Claude Code CLI v0.x
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
**Usage Period:** 2025-01-20 to present

**Primary Use Cases:**

1. **Infrastructure Setup** (Extensive)
   * Generated multi-chain CI/CD pipelines (Ethereum, Polygon, Internet Computer)
   * Created 4 Nickel configuration files with blockchain-specific stages
   * Generated smart contract testing and deployment automation
   * Created .tool-versions for Solidity, Node.js, dfx (IC SDK)
   * Generated 40+ dotfiles for multi-chain development

2. **Rhodium Compliance Documentation** (Extensive)
   * Created .rhodium/LEVEL, WAIVER.adoc (6 waivers including blockchain-specific), compliance.json
   * Documented smart contract deployment irreversibility constraints
   * Created blockchain-specific REVERSIBILITY.adoc guidance (upgrade patterns, not rollback)
   * Generated this AI_USAGE.adoc

3. **Blockchain-Specific Considerations**
   * Documented testnet vs mainnet rollback differences
   * Created proxy pattern upgrade documentation templates
   * Generated carbon reporting considerations for PoS chains
   * Created SLSA attestation strategy for smart contract bytecode

**Human Oversight:** All infrastructure reviewed by blockchain specialist. Smart contract code 100% human-written with security audit requirements.

**Code Quality:** Generated infrastructure tested on testnets before mainnet consideration.

== AI-Generated vs Human-Written Content

=== 100% AI-Generated (Reviewed by Human)

* Multi-chain CI/CD pipeline configurations
* Nickel configuration files
* .rhodium/ compliance structure with blockchain adaptations
* Infrastructure automation scripts
* This AI_USAGE.adoc

=== 100% Human-Written (NEVER AI-Generated)

* **All smart contract code** (Solidity, Vyper, Motoko)
* Security-critical contract logic
* Cryptographic implementations
* Token economics and governance mechanisms
* Deployment scripts (reviewed, not generated)
* Audit findings and remediation

== Blockchain-Specific AI Limitations

=== Smart Contract Development

**POLICY:** AI tools are NEVER used for smart contract code generation due to:

* Financial risk of bugs (immutable deployments)
* Security audit requirements
* Gas optimization needs (AI may generate inefficient code)
* Legal liability concerns

**AI Usage Restricted To:** Infrastructure, documentation, testing scaffolding only.

=== Immutability Constraints

AI-generated REVERSIBILITY.adoc documents upgrade patterns, not rollback:

* Mainnet deployments are irreversible
* Proxy patterns (EIP-1967, Diamond Standard) for upgradeability
* Human review ensures upgrade safety mechanisms

== Training Data Considerations

**Blockchain-Specific Concerns:**

* AI trained on public smart contracts (may include vulnerable code patterns)
* Mitigation: Human security review, third-party audits
* No proprietary contract logic shared with AI

== Ethical Considerations

=== Financial Risk Disclosure

* AI-generated infrastructure only; no financial logic
* Smart contracts independently audited
* Testnet testing mandatory before mainnet

=== Carbon Footprint

* AI usage for infrastructure documentation: ~0.3kg CO2
* Blockchain runtime carbon (PoS chains) tracked separately
* Testnet usage carbon measured with CodeCarbon

* Open an issue with label: `ai-transparency`
* For smart contract security: See SECURITY.adoc
* Audit reports: docs/audits/
