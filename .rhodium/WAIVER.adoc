== Active Waivers

=== Waiver-2025-001: SLSA Attestation Implementation

**Requirement:** SLSA v1.0 provenance + in-toto attestation (Pillar 1, Section 2.1.2)

**Status:** WAIVED until 2025-06-01

**Justification:**

Multi-chain smart contract deployment pipelines are in place for Ethereum, Polygon, and Internet Computer. However, SLSA attestation for blockchain artifacts has unique challenges:

* Smart contract bytecode attestation
* Multi-chain deployment provenance tracking
* Integration with Sigstore/Rekor for blockchain artifacts

**Remediation Plan:**

* 2025-03: Set up Sigstore Cosign for smart contract artifacts
* 2025-04: Implement deployment provenance for Ethereum/Polygon contracts
* 2025-05: Extend attestation to Internet Computer canisters
* 2025-06: Full SLSA v1.0 compliance across all chains

**Signed By:** Infrastructure team (blockchain specialist)
**Expiry:** 2025-06-01 (auto-enforced by CI gate)

---

=== Waiver-2025-002: Post-Quantum Cryptographic Signatures

**Requirement:** Ed448 or ML-DSA hybrid signatures (Pillar 1, Section 2.1.1)

**Status:** EXPIRED (was 2026-01-01) — Crypto policy now defined

**Justification:**

Previously using Ed25519 signatures for repository commits. Blockchain-specific considerations:

* Smart contracts use blockchain-native signature schemes (ECDSA for Ethereum, EdDSA for ICP)
* Post-quantum blockchain migration is ecosystem-level decision, not project-level
* Repository signatures can upgrade independently of on-chain cryptography

**Current State:** Ed25519 for git commits (deprecated per `CRYPTO-POLICY.adoc`). Full post-quantum + classical hybrid policy defined.

**Crypto Policy Reference:** `CRYPTO-POLICY.adoc` (CPR-003, CPR-004, CPR-005)

**Target algorithms:**

* **Signatures:** Ed448 + Dilithium5-AES hybrid (ML-DSA-87, FIPS 204)
* **Key exchange:** Kyber-1024 (ML-KEM-1024, FIPS 203)
* **Fallback:** SPHINCS+ (SLH-DSA, FIPS 205)

**Remediation Status (updated 2026-02-14):**

* ✅ BLAKE3 content hashing — graphql-dns-api (DONE)
* ✅ XChaCha20-Poly1305 symmetric — odns-rs/crypto (DONE)
* ✅ Ed448+Dilithium5 hybrid signatures — odns-rs/signatures + graphql-dns-api DNSSEC (DONE)
* ✅ Kyber-1024 KEM — odns-rs/crypto (DONE)
* ✅ SPHINCS+ fallback — odns-rs/sphincs_fallback (DONE)
* ✅ oDNS Rust rewrite with PQ crypto — ADR-0003 implemented, Go code removed (DONE)
* ⬜ Consent-api BLAKE3+hybrid signing via Rust WASM (PENDING)

**Signed By:** Security team
**Original Expiry:** 2026-01-01
**Waiver Status:** EXPIRED — replaced by CRYPTO-POLICY.adoc migration timeline

---

=== Waiver-2025-003: WASM Compilation Target

**Requirement:** WASM-first compilation with fallback (Pillar 3, Section 2.3.1)

**Status:** WAIVED until 2025-09-01

**Justification:**

Smart contracts compile to chain-specific targets:

* **Ethereum/Polygon:** Solidity/Vyper → EVM bytecode (not WASM)
* **Internet Computer:** Motoko → WASM (ALREADY COMPLIANT)
* **ReScript frontend:** Can compile to WASM

**Partial Compliance:** Internet Computer canisters already use WASM as native target.

**Remediation Plan:**

* 2025-04: Evaluate EVM → WASM transpilation options (experimental)
* 2025-05: Implement WASM build targets for ReScript frontend components
* 2025-07: Document WASM compliance per component (IC: native, EVM: not applicable, frontend: compliant)
* 2025-09: Multi-target WASM strategy documented in ADR

**Signed By:** Architecture team
**Expiry:** 2025-09-01

---

=== Waiver-2025-004: WCAG AAA Accessibility

**Requirement:** WCAG 2.2 AAA for all documentation (Pillar 3, Section 2.3.4)

**Status:** WAIVED until 2026-03-01

**Justification:**

Current documentation meets WCAG AA standards. AAA compliance requires enhanced contrast, sign language for videos, and reading level optimization.

**Current State:** WCAG 2.2 AA compliant

**Remediation Plan:**

* 2025-09: Accessibility audit focused on blockchain terminology (simplify explanations)
* 2025-12: Implement enhanced contrast and semantic structure
* 2026-02: Add extended descriptions for smart contract diagrams
* 2026-03: Full WCAG AAA compliance

**Signed By:** Documentation team
**Expiry:** 2026-03-01

---

=== Waiver-2025-005: Carbon Reporting CI Gates

**Requirement:** Carbon footprint CI gates at baseline +20% (Pillar 4, Section 2.4.4)

**Status:** WAIVED until 2025-07-01

**Justification:**

Blockchain projects have unique carbon considerations:

* **Build-time carbon:** CI/CD pipeline energy usage (measurable)
* **Runtime carbon:** Smart contract execution on Proof-of-Stake chains (lower impact)
* **Testnet usage:** Development testing energy (measurable)

**Current State:** No carbon measurement infrastructure

**Remediation Plan:**

* 2025-02: Integrate CodeCarbon for CI pipeline measurement
* 2025-02 to 2025-05: Baseline data collection (3 months)
* 2025-06: Document carbon impact of smart contract testing strategies
* 2025-07: Enable CI gates at baseline +20%, with blockchain-specific thresholds

**Signed By:** Infrastructure team
**Expiry:** 2025-07-01

---

=== Waiver-2025-006: REVERSIBILITY for Smart Contract Deployments

**Requirement:** Documented rollback procedures (Pillar 1, Section 2.1.5)

**Status:** PARTIAL WAIVER until 2025-08-01

**Justification:**

Smart contract deployments have **inherent irreversibility** on blockchain:

* **Cannot rollback:** On-chain state changes are permanent
* **Can upgrade:** Via proxy patterns (EIP-1967, Diamond Standard)
* **Can migrate:** Deploy new contract, migrate state

**Partial Compliance:** REVERSIBILITY.adoc will document:

1. ✅ Repository/code rollback procedures (fully reversible)
2. ✅ Testnet deployment rollback (can redeploy)
3. ⚠️ Mainnet deployment: Document upgrade patterns, NOT rollback (impossible)

**Remediation Plan:**

* 2025-04: Document upgrade patterns for all deployed contracts
* 2025-05: Create emergency pause mechanisms for critical contracts
* 2025-06: Implement timelocked upgrades for governance
* 2025-08: REVERSIBILITY.adoc complete with blockchain-specific guidance

**Signed By:** Smart contract security team
**Expiry:** 2025-08-01 (partial compliance acceptable for blockchain reality)

== Blockchain-Specific Compliance Notes

**Smart Contract Immutability:**

The nature of blockchain technology creates inherent tension with Rhodium's reversibility requirement. This is documented in Waiver-2025-006 and acknowledged as a fundamental limitation of decentralized systems.

**Compliance Approach:**

* ✅ **Repository level:** Fully reversible (git, code)
* ✅ **Testnet level:** Fully reversible (redeploy at will)
* ⚠️ **Mainnet level:** Upgrade patterns only (via proxy contracts)
* ❌ **On-chain state:** Cannot rollback (blockchain immutability guarantee)

This differentiation will be clearly documented in REVERSIBILITY.adoc and ARCHITECTURE.adoc.

---

== Waiver Policy

**Automatic Expiry:** Waivers expire on the date specified. CI gates will enforce compliance after expiry unless waiver is renewed.

**Renewal Process:** Submit ADR documenting justification, updated plan, risk assessment, and sign-off.

**Maximum Extension:** 6 months per renewal, 2 renewals maximum (18 months total)

**Permanent Exemption:** For blockchain-specific impossibilities (e.g., mainnet state rollback), requires ADR with security review.
