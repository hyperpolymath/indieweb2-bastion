== Current Status

**Compliance Level:** ⚠️ **Partial**

=== Per-Chain Compliance

**✅ Internet Computer:**
* **WASM:** Native (Motoko compiles to WASM)
* **Status:** Fully compliant

**❌ Ethereum/Polygon:**
* **Bytecode:** EVM bytecode (NOT WASM)
* **Status:** Non-compliant (by design)

== WASM Strategy

See link:docs/adr/0002-multi-chain-architecture.adoc[ADR-0002: Multi-Chain Architecture] for details.

**Rationale for partial compliance:**

1. **Internet Computer** uses WASM natively (canisters)
2. **EVM chains** use EVM bytecode (industry standard)
3. **No viable EVM→WASM path** without breaking compatibility

== Waivers

**Current waiver:** Waiver-2025-002 (EVM bytecode accepted as equivalent to WASM for blockchain deployment)

**Justification:** EVM bytecode is the industry-standard compilation target for Ethereum smart contracts. WASM support on EVM is experimental (eWASM), not production-ready.
